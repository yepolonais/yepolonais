- 👋 Hi, I’m @yepolonais, I live in Bordeaux, FR.
- 👀 I’m interested in development in C# .net, Angular and React.
- 🌱 I’m currently polishing my skills on C# .net 5.0 and "vanilla" Javascript. 
-    Right now I'm reading "Eloquent Javascript" By Marijn Haverbeke (and reading it again and again, to grasp it fully ^^)
- 💞️ My next step will be to be an expert in multithreading, which I find fascinating. 
- 📫 You can reach me on this github profile, or on LinkedIn.
